<h1 align="center">Graph Visualizer</h1>

## Description
The `Graph Visualizer` program provides a GUI for exploring graphs using appropriate algorithms. 

## Provided algorithms
* Basic algorithms
  - [ ] graph layouts on the plane
  - [ ] highlighting key vertices
  - [ ] search for communities
* Classical algorithms
  - [ ] isolation of strongly connected components (directed graph)
  - [ ] finding bridges (undirected graph)
  - [ ] finding cycles for a given vertex
  - [ ] constructing a minimum spanning tree (undirected graph)
  - [ ] finding the shortest path between a pair of vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm
  - [ ] finding the shortest path between a pair of vertices using the Ford-Bellman algorithm

## Saving graphs
* reading and saving a graph at file in `csv` or `json` format
* reading and saving a graph at SQLite DB
* reading and saving a graph at Neo4j DB

## Getting started
To run building application execute command:
```bash
./gradlew build
```
